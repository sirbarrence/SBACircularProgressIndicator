# Circular Progress Indicator View for iOS

This is a simple progress indicator that looks a bit like the ones shown in the 
iOS App Store app when downloading an app or update. It also has an indeterminate 
mode inspired by Google Chrome's tab indicators.

See SBACircularProgressIndicator.h for docs. See SBAViewController.m for usage 
examples.
